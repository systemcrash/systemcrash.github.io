<h2>Spelling and grammar of English</h2>

<p>Welcome, plebeian of the English language. I apologise that you must endure this language and its idiosyncrasies. It could do with an overhaul of its spelling, but until then, deal with it. How it&#39;s written today is in use by billions of people, and if you wish to communicate accurately, here is a list of fixes to common errors (which are unforgivable) to make your un-nuanced text more comprehensible.</p>

<p><br />
While this page does not attempt to be <em>the</em> authority on how things should be in English, it does intend to lay bare your grievous grammatical and insidious spelling mistakes and humiliate you in the process, while also perhaps teaching the web how to do things.. correctly.</p>

<p><br />
A bit on how we use the word correct: since there is no one official arbiter for the English language, and instead it is based on chronological consensus, it takes a while for some new words and expressions to land in dictionaries. This page may accept both British and American spelling in general, since they are both recognisable. But when in doubt, use British, since it is correct. ;) If, god forbid, you encounter some weird Canadian spelling or expression, avoid it. Just... avoid.</p>

<p>Did someone send you a link to this page? Yes? No? Who the fuck cares. You are here now, and that is all that matters. It contains the goodly wisdom you need to correct your errant ways. Read on.</p>

<p>* yes grammarians have fucked us with their use of which is subject and object. Subjects are introduced as the doer. Objects are introduced as the doee, the one whom is acted upon.</p>

<p>Noun = thing. Verb = action. Idiom = an expression whose different words with different meanings take on some new weird meaning.</p>

<p>Adverb = describe the verb&#39;s action.</p>

<p>Adjective = describe the noun (thing).</p>

<hr />
<h3>The difference between &quot;it is&quot;, and &quot;his, her, its&quot;. Frankly, there is no similarity.</h3>

<p>Incorrect: I gave the dog it&#39;s food.</p>

<p>Correct: I gave the dog its food.</p>

<p>You are castigated here because you are a savage, cold-hearted beast who gave a dog away as food to a hungry china-man who eats dogs. Freak. Not least you probably also cannot punctuate.</p>

<p>Frankly, we all look forward to the day when there will be no apostrophes in written English. Such is already on the way in, and makes things a bit easier to read. One of the apostrophe&#39;s purposes is to highlight an omission, or contraction: something was removed. It is = it&#39;s.&nbsp; Those forms have been around for so long that they have ossified into a stable form. So writing everything as &quot;its&quot; is always acceptable, whereas making the mistake of &quot;it&#39;s&quot; when you meant &quot;its&quot; makes you as bad as a dog eater. Stop it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<h3>Plural or Possessive?</h3>

<p>Do this: I have five dogs.</p>

<p>Avoid this: I have five dog&#39;s. &lt;-- what the fuck?</p>

<hr />
<h3>Verb form or noun form?</h3>

<p>Do this: I set the computer up. &lt;-- native normal.</p>

<p>Or do this: I set up the computer. &lt;-- you still sound weird.</p>

<p>Avoid this: I setup the computer. &lt;-- WTAF?</p>

<p>You are reprimanded here because... aside from being a village idiot who does not know a noun from an phrasal verb expression with preposition, you are not communicating what you actually mean to.</p>

<p>Do you go around saying &quot;I pumpkin the ketchup!&quot;? Do you really? Weirdo. It&#39;s no wonder nobody understands you. You Russian.</p>

<p>Nobody says: &quot;I setuped the computer&quot;. They say &quot;I set the computer up&quot;. ( Yes, past tense of set (verb) is set. )</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do this: Log in / Log out</p>

<p>Avoid this: Login / Logout</p>

<p>To log in is an action. Buttons to do so are action buttons. A fucking verb. You don&#39;t &quot;I logined to my pyooturh!&quot;, god no. Humans do this: &quot;I logged in to my computer&quot;.</p>

<p>If you <strong>must</strong> write the noun, login, there are myriad synonyms you can use instead, even if some are longer and tax the average ape sized brain due to their French-ish origin and fingers due to key-press amount: authentication details, account, credentials, ...</p>

<hr />
<h3>Use an adverb with your verb instead of an adjective.</h3>

<p>Do this: You did it well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do it well.</p>

<p>Avoid this: You did it good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do it good. &lt;-- WTF you slave-master psycho.</p>

<p>He is not called &quot;good&quot;, but that&#39;s besides the point, which you fecklessly implied. We do not have words and expressions such as wellbeing, well-to-do, wellness, well-informed, well-done, and others by accident. We have them thanks to adverbs. If you want to sound more &quot;gangsta&quot; for more broad appeal and marketability, use the variant that makes you sound like a psycho. If you want humanity to evolve, and human brain capacity to expand as part of evolution so that in the future man may attain telepathy, as opposed to apathy where we start dragging our knuckles on the ground once again, use the first.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Avoid redundancy</h3>

<p>Do this: I gotta do this.</p>

<p>Avoid this: I gotta to do this. &lt;-- JFC you Russian spy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<h3>Use an adjective when comparing</h3>

<p>Do this: The are fewer midgets than there were before.</p>

<p>Avoid this: There are less midgets than there were before. &lt;-- You sick fuck.</p>

<p>Less means the same number, just... less OF it. Compare: a lesser man vs fewer men. When you visit a brothel, it&#39;s better to have fewer men than a lesser man.</p>

<p>Fewer is a comparative (Few: adjective, fewer: comparative adjective, fewest: superlative adjective) adjective. Example: I gave fewer fucks today than yesterday ( Meaning the number you gave today is lower than yesterday).</p>

<p>Less is an adverb. Example: I gave him less shit today than yesterday. ( Meaning the amount you gave today is lower than yesterday ).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rule: If it is countable, use fewer (objects). If it is measurable, use less (water).</p>

<hr />
<h3>End with however for nevertheless, start with however for &quot;to whatever extent&quot;.</h3>

<p>Do this: I don&#39;t think she understood you, however.</p>

<p>Avoid this: However I don&#39;t think she understood you.</p>

<p>The first implies you are sane, and that how so ever much you tried, she still did not understand you. The second implies how so ever you do not think, she actually understood you. Wait, what?</p>

<p>Let us see what old mister Strunk has to say on the matter:&nbsp; &quot;In the meaning &#39;nevertheless&#39;, it does not come first in its sentence or clause. ... When however comes first, it means &#39;in whatever way&#39; or &#39;to whatever extent&#39;.&quot;</p>

<hr />
<h3>Avoid sounding like an illiterate</h3>

<p>Do this: I saw him five seconds ago.</p>

<p>Avoid this: I saw him literally five seconds ago.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_and_figurative_language">Spend a moment to discern figurative from literal. </a>You savage.</p>

<hr />
<h3>It is not possible to <em>not</em> do something</h3>

<p>Do this: He told him not to shout.</p>

<p>Do this: I warned you not to do that.</p>

<p>Avoid peasantry: He told him to not shout.</p>

<p>Avoid fuckery: I warned you to not do that.</p>

<p>This infinitive don&#39;t split, yo. How the fuck do you &quot;to not&quot; something? Which elephant anus did you drop from at birth? Human logic is predicated on affirmative action, to do something. For our minds to process a negation, it first has to be able to process the affirmative, to then slap a negative in there, to be able to comprehend it. Why are you making things so complicated.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Keep it simple: avoid instantiation</h3>

<p>Do this: When we drink beer, we look at photos of Taylor Swift.</p>

<p>Avoid this: When we are drinking beer, we look at photos of Taylor Swift.</p>

<p>Some anus among you might try to point out &quot;but the are syntactically different!&quot; and hope to be right. Fuck you. You are wrong. They have the same meaning. One is shorter!</p>

<hr />
<h3>If -&gt; whether</h3>

<p>Do this: I do not know whether we can go.</p>

<p>Avoid this: I do not know if we can go.</p>

<p>Do this: He was saying whether we could go.</p>

<p>Avoid this: He was saying if we could go.</p>

<p>Okidoki, shit for brains. In programming languages which are basically sequential logic, everything is composed of &quot;if&quot; branches, and every other operation is just mental masturbation on top of &quot;if&quot;. The word &quot;IF&quot; means &quot;if this, then that&quot;, where if stands in for &quot;in the case (of)&quot;. The correct way of expressing a branch of possibilities as a human being is through the word &quot;whether&quot;, implying &quot;whether or not&quot;, whose origins are from &quot;which of the two&quot;. Its comparative form is &quot;either&quot;. As in &quot;either we go or we do not&quot;.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Avoid sounding like a fourth grader (unless you really are)</h3>

<p>Do this: My friends and I went to the bazaar.</p>

<p>Avoid this: Me and my friends went to the bazaar.</p>

<p>Me went to the fair? Wut? Just... no.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<h3>Use than to compare, then to sequence</h3>

<p>Do this: That hot girl likes me more than you.</p>

<p>Avoid this: That hot girl likes me more then you.</p>

<p>Well, if you say so. Dipshit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>More heinous examples coming as the world grapples with English a bit more.</p>
